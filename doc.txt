# integrating react frontend with the Django backend   [Frontend already exists]

Create a separate folder for backend
1. Create a folder named backend [mkdir movie_bluff_backend, cd movie_bluff_backend]

2. Create a virtual environment [python -m venv venv]

3. Activate the virtual environment [source venv/bin/activate]

4. If you Know the required packages install them. Installed DRF [pip install django djangorestframework, ]

5. Start working on creating a new project [django-admin startproject movie_bluff .]  -> creates a project in folder

6. Create an API folder [python manage.py startapp users ] -> [you're building a RESTful API for your React frontend for signup/login]
    
    This users app will hold all logic related to:
        Defining models (data)
        Writing views (API logic)
        Serializing data
        Creating API endpoints
    ]

7. Update settings.py including all the installed apps

8. Add this to settings.py  

    Before that install "pip install django-cors-headers" 

    [ CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS = True ]     ->   this is to enable the connection to the backend if frontend requests it.

    By default browsers block cross-origin HTTP requests for security reasons. So it allows your React app to communicate with your Django API.


TASK 1: [Providing  login + registration]
    
	STEPS:
	1.  Establish the database connection [ using the existing sqllite]
	2.  Didn't create any models as we are using default sqlite [if wanted customized table create the model]
	3. Create a super user
	4. 


		











	react:
            Login/signup -> if clicked login should redirect to database -> perform validation check -> response back to the user
					-> if signing up -> redirect the data into the database check if already exists , or not -> response the desired 
						output info [ if exists tell already exists else store the data into the database and redirect to login]
				

				1. Create the database [required table ] in the database
				2. Establish the connection [change data saving from local storage to database table]
